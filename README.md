# Matrix Discord Bridge

A bridge between [Matrix](http://matrix.org/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/).
Currently the bridge is in **Beta** and quite usable for everyday 
bridging, with one or two bugs cropping up.

## Helping out

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord)

### PRs
PRs are graciously accepted, so please come talk to us in [#discord-bridge:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#discord-bridge:matrix.org)
about any neat ideas you might have. If you are going to make a change, please merge it with the `develop` branch :).

### Issues
You can also file bug reports/ feature requests on Github Issues which also helps a ton. Please remember to include logs.
Please also be aware that this is an unoffical project worked on in my (Half-Shot) spare time.

## Setting up

(These instructions were tested against Node.js v6.9.5 and the Synapse homeserver)

### Setup the bridge

* Run ``npm install`` to grab the dependencies.
* Run ``npm run-script build`` to build the typescript.
* Copy ``config/config.sample.yaml`` to ``config.yaml`` and edit it to reflect your setup.
  * Note that you are expected to set ``domain`` and ``homeserverURL`` to your **public** host name.
  While localhost would work, it does not resolve correctly with Webhooks/Avatars.

  ````
  bridge:
  domain: "example.com"
  homeserverUrl: "https://example.com:8448"
  ````

* Run ``node build/src/discordas.js -r -u "http://localhost:9005" -c config.yaml``
* Modify your HSs appservices config so that it includes the generated file.
  * e.g. On synapse, adding to ``app_service_config_files`` array in ``homeserver.yaml``

  ````
  app_service_config_files:
  - "discord-registration.yaml"
  ````

  * Copy ``discord-registration.yaml`` to your Synapse's directory.

#### Docker

Following the instructions above, generate a registration file. The file may also be hand-crafted if you're familiar with the layout. You'll need this file to use the Docker image.

```
# Create the volume where we'll keep the bridge's files
mkdir -p /matrix-appservice-discord

# Create the configuration file. Use the sample configuration file as a template.
# Be sure to set the database paths to something like this:
#  database:
#    filename: "/data/discord.db"
#    userStorePath: "/data/user-store.db"
#    roomStorePath: "/data/room-store.db"
nano /matrix-appservice-discord/config.yaml

# Copy the registration file to the volume
cp discord-registration.yaml /matrix-appservice-discord/discord-registration.yaml

# Optional: Build the container yourself (requires a git clone, and to be in the root of the project)
docker build -t half-shot/matrix-appservice-discord .

# Run the container
docker run -v /matrix-appservice-discord:/data -p 9005:9005 half-shot/matrix-appservice-discord
```

#### 3PID Protocol Support

This bridge support searching for rooms within networks via the 3pid system
used in clients like [Riot](https://riot.im). However, it requires a small
manual change to your registration file. Change the end of
`discord-registration.yaml` to `protocols: ["discord"]`` and restart both your
bridge and synapse. Any new servers/guilds you bridge should show up in the
network list on Riot and other clients.

### Setting up Discord

* Create a new application via https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create
* Make sure to create a bot user. Fill in ``config.yaml``
* Run ``npm run-script getbotlink`` to get a authorisation link.
* Give this link to owners of the guilds you plan to bridge.
* Finally, you can join a room with ``#_discord_guildid_channelid``
  * These can be taken from the url ("/$GUILDID/$CHANNELID") when you are in a channel.
  * Riot (and other clients with third party protocol support) users can directly join channels from the room directory.
* You can use Webhooks to make messages relayed by the bridge not nested by the bot user. This will also display the avatar of the user speaking on matrix with their messages.
  * The bot should create this automatically, but if not perform the following:
    * Enable ``Manage Webhooks`` on the role added by the bot.
    * Add the ``_matrix`` Webhook for each channel you'd like to enable this feature on.

### Running the Bridge

* For the bot to appear online on Discord you need to run the bridge itself.
* ``npm start``
